# Model-release tickets

The hyperscaler model timeline is a **persistent set of tickets**, not a
daily-regenerated table. Each upcoming release, rumor, partnership, or
legal event is one ticket. The daily workflow (`24h-model-timeline.yml`)
runs an agent that **CRUDs** tickets — create new ones, update existing
ones, close resolved ones — based on the last 24 hours of signal.

Tickets live at `research/models/tickets/<slug>.md`. Each file is
markdown with a YAML frontmatter block defining the structured fields,
followed by a free-form body.

This doc is the **contract**: the CRUD agent reads it each run, and the
validator (`scripts/check_model_tickets.py`) enforces it. Keep it in
sync with the validator.

## File layout

├── 2026-05-17-timeline.md       # legacy daily table (frozen)
└── 2026-05-19-timeline.md       # NEW format: daily diff summary derived from ticket changes
```

The pre-tickets `<date>-timeline.md` files (large markdown tables) stay
on disk so old dashboard URLs don't 404, but they are not updated.
New dates produce a *diff summary* instead — see "Daily diff" below.

## Frontmatter schema

```yaml

model: Mythos                      # optional, the named model/product the ticket tracks; null for non-model events
status: in-testing                 # required, one of the 5 canonical states (see below)
status_note: |                     # optional, free text for the nuance the canonical state can't carry

```

After the closing `---`, the body is free-form markdown. Use it for the
"why this matters" narrative, deeper context, and any commentary that
doesn't fit a structured field. The body is what an analyst reads to
understand the ticket; the frontmatter is what filters and dashboards
read.

## Canonical lifecycle (5 states)

| State        | Meaning                                                                                  |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `rumored`    | Speculation only — single-source tease, prediction, "Polymarket says...", no artifact   |
| `in-testing` | Real artifact exists: private preview, leak, internal usage, GCP/AWS console listing    |
| `confirmed`  | Official announcement, primary-source news, or multi-source corroboration               |
| `released`   | Publicly available right now (anyone can use it)                                        |
| `closed`     | Resolved — shipped & rolled into normal coverage, OR disproved, OR superseded            |

State transitions are monotonic except for `released → closed`:
```
  rumored → in-testing → confirmed → released → closed
                                      ↓
                                    closed (without released, if disproved/superseded)
```

If the underlying claim flips (e.g. "Gemini 3.5 expected" gets disproved
when Gemini 3.2 leaks), the old ticket closes with `closed_reason:
superseded-by:<other-slug>` and a new ticket carries the new shape.
Never rewrite history on the closed ticket.

Mapping from the legacy table's freeform statuses:

| Legacy status              | Canonical    |
|----------------------------|--------------|
| Rumored, Speculated, Predicted | `rumored`    |
| In Discussion, In Development, In Testing | `in-testing` |
| Confirmed, Announced, Reaffirmed, Reported | `confirmed`  |
| _(rolled out to users)_    | `released`   |
| _(shipped + ≥4 weeks old, OR disproved)_ | `closed`     |

The legacy status's nuance ("Confirmed event; tier now skewing to 3.2",
"In Testing — GCP console artifact") goes into `status_note`.

## Verification flag

The legacy table uses `⚠` / `🚩 Unverified — STILL NO PRIMARY CONFIRM N CYCLES`
for claims that haven't been primary-source corroborated. The new ticket
captures this in `verification`:

| Value         | Meaning                                                                     |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `confirmed`   | At least one primary source (company blog, official handle, court filing)   |
| `partial`     | Multiple secondary corroborations but no primary source yet                 |
| `unverified`  | Single-source tease, or a claim that hasn't been corroborated in ≥10 cycles |

If a ticket sits at `unverified` for more than ~15 daily cycles, the
CRUD agent may close it with `closed_reason: stale-rumor-unverified`.

## Slug conventions

- Lowercase ASCII, hyphen-separated, no underscores
- Format: `<company>-<artifact>-<distinguisher>`, e.g. `gemini-3-2-flash`,
  `anthropic-30b-series-f`, `openai-apple-legal-action`
- Stable for the lifetime of the ticket. The agent **must not** rename
  slugs. If a name changes (e.g. "Gemini 3.5" turns out to be "Gemini 3.2"),
  keep the original slug and update `title` + add a history entry.
- Version numbers in slugs use hyphen-separated digits: `opus-4-7` not
  `opus-4.7` (dots cause filesystem ambiguity).
- For news/event tickets without a named artifact, use
  `<company>-<short-noun>-<yyyy-mm>`, e.g.
  `anthropic-stainless-acquisition-2026-05`.

## CRUD dedup protocol

This section is the **contract the CRUD agent must follow**. Quote it
in the workflow prompt verbatim.

On each daily run, for each candidate event surfaced in the last 24h of
signal:

1. **List existing tickets** by reading `research/models/tickets/*.md`.
   Build a map of `{ company, model, status }` → slug.

2. **Match the candidate** against existing tickets. The agent must
   answer: "Is this signal about the same *shipping artifact* as an
   existing ticket?" Same shipping artifact means:
   - Same model name (allowing for version-number drift, e.g. "Gemini
     3.5" vs "Gemini 3.2 Flash" — see #4), AND
   - Same release event (a single product reveal, single partnership
     announcement, single funding round)

3. **If matched**:
   - If the existing ticket is **not closed**: update it. Add a `history`
     entry summarizing what changed. Update `status` if the lifecycle
     advanced. Update `status_note`, `expected`, `sources` as needed.
     Bump `updated_at`. Do NOT touch `created_at`, `slug`, or
     re-write earlier `history` entries.
   - If the existing ticket **is closed**: leave it alone. If the new
     signal contradicts the closure (e.g. a disproved rumor is now
     real), create a NEW ticket with `created_at = today` whose body
     references the closed ticket by slug.

4. **If no match**: create a new ticket. Pick a slug per conventions.
   Set `created_at = updated_at = today`, `status` per the strongest
   evidence (default `rumored` for single-source teases),
   `verification` honestly. Seed `history` with one entry: `Created`.

5. **Close** any ticket that meets one of:
   - Has shipped publicly ≥4 weeks ago AND is in `released` state
     (transition to `closed` with `closed_reason: released-and-aged`)
   - Has been `unverified` for ≥15 daily cycles with no new
     corroboration (`closed_reason: stale-rumor-unverified`)
   - Is contradicted by today's signal AND there's a successor ticket
     (`closed_reason: superseded-by:<successor-slug>`)

6. **Never delete**. Closing preserves history; deletion does not.

## Daily diff

The CRUD agent produces a derived markdown file at
`research/models/<date>-timeline.md` summarizing what changed that day.
This keeps the existing dashboard URL pattern (`/models/YYYY-MM-DD`)
working without modification. Shape:

```markdown
# Model Timeline — Diff for 2026-05-19

## 🆕 Created (3)
- `gemini-3-2-flash` — Google / DeepMind — In Testing — GCP console artifact
  ([ticket](/tickets/gemini-3-2-flash))
- ...

## 🔄 Updated (5)
- `mythos-public-release` — Anthropic — status: in-testing (unchanged)
  - GCP Vertex AI Private Preview confirmed via blog
  - ([ticket](/tickets/mythos-public-release))
- ...

## ✅ Closed (1)
- `gemini-3-5-expected` — superseded by `gemini-3-2-flash`
- ...

## 🌐 No change today (32)
_(collapsed list of slugs)_
```

The dashboard's date tab renders this markdown. The "tickets" tab
renders the card grid from `index.json` directly.

## Validator

`scripts/check_model_tickets.py` enforces this schema. Run with no args
to validate every ticket in `research/models/tickets/`. Exit 0 on
success, exit 1 on any failure with line numbers and reasons.

The CRUD agent must re-run the validator at the end of every daily run.
If it fails, the agent fixes the offending ticket in-place and re-runs.
The workflow commits only when validator is clean.
